# My linux configs

## config.conf (Minimal neofetch)

my minimal neofetch config

this should go without saying but you will need neofetch installed already

go down to line 723 and change the Ascii distro unless you want to keep the small Arcolinux logo there are lots of comments that you can follow and I would recommend customising the config

you will need to go to "**_/.config/neofetch_**" and save this config file and remove you're old config file

the auto function doesn't work with these settings for whatever reason and it just shows a distorted tux penguin

## Flashy

**_/.config/neofetch_**

flashy version of the minimal neofetch config

go down to line 723 and change the Ascii distro unless you want to keep the Arcolinux logo there are lots of comments that you can follow and I would recommend customising the config

change the files name to **config.conf**

just follow the instuctions for the minimal config

## Bpytop

**_/.config/bpytop_**

just swap the bpytop config that I have for the one you have

## Bashtop

**_/.config/bashtop_**

follow the instructions for bpytop they're pretty similiar
