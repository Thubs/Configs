# flashy

path: /home/ (insert user here) /.config/neofetch

flashy version of the minimal config
change the name to config.conf

# config.conf

my neofetch config

this should go without saying but you will need neofetch installed already

go down to line 766 and change the Ascii distro unless you want to keep the small Arch logo there are lot's of commenting and I would recommend customising the config

you will need to go to "/.config/neofetch" and save this config file and remove you're old config file

the auto function doesn't work with these settings for whatever reason and it just shows a distorted tux penguin

minimal neofetch install.

# bpytop

path: /home/ (insert user here) /.config/bpytop

just swap the bpytop config that I have for the one you have.
